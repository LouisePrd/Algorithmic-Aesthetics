# Algorithmic Aesthetics - Ex 1 et 2

Using <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">P5</a> framework to mix art and science<br>
JS framework for creative coding projects<br>

## Instruction

### Exercise 1
Create a representation of Copernic Campus at night or Descartes Campus, including architectural elements<br>
Maximum dimensions: 1280x720px<br>
Include in the code :
- Comments on work, choices (title and give image title)
- Index 1 object in P5 references: summarize in a few words

### Exercise 2
Color grid: 1000x1000 and produce a grid of colored squares of 10x10 cells<br>
Choose a palette of 12 colors<br>
Both color harmonies and contrasts + margins on the edges<br>
1/ Select colors<br>
2/ Dispatch them: which goes where<br>
Idea: the result should highlight both harmony and contrast<br>
Comment: add a list of concepts (4 minimum) that reflects the quality of the color grid

### Exercise 3
Imagine an algorithm similar to the one that could have created one of Hiroshi Kawano's works (first programming artist in the 1960s)<br>
